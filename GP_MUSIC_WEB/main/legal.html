                        features or functionality made available through the Platform, at our discretion. The date of

                        this page from time to time for updates.

                        When we make any material changes to these Terms of Use, we will provide you with prominent
                        notice under the circumstances, including for example displaying a notice within the Platform
                        and/or by sending you an email to the email address that you have provided us or a message to

                        You will have no obligation to continue using the Platform following any such notification, but
                        if you do not terminate your account as described in the Termination section below during such
                        two (2) week period, your continued use of the Platform after the end of that two (2) week
                        period will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms of Use.</div>
                    <div class="legal-header">Description of the Platform</div>
                    <div class="legal-desc">The Platform is a hosting service. Registered users of the Platform may
                        submit, upload and post audio, text, photos, pictures, graphics, comments, and other content,
                        data or information ("Content"), which will be stored by SoundCloud at the direction of such
                        registered users, and may be shared and distributed by such registered users, and other users of
                        the Platform, using the tools and features provided as part of the Platform and accessible via
                        the Website, Apps and elsewhere. The Platform also enables registered users to interact with one
                        another and to contribute to discussions, and enables any user of the Website, Apps or certain
                        Services (who may or may not be registered users of the Platform) to view, listen to and share
                        Content uploaded and made available by registered users.

                        The Platform also includes social and interactive features that enable users to engage with and
                        learn from the SoundCloud community in order to build a following and ensure you get the content
                        that interests you most. For example, users who upload content to SoundCloud will gain access to
                        our creator stats feature, which provides creators with insights into how the content they
                        upload fares among users, including which users are top listeners and downloaders of such
                        content.

                        Some features of our Platform are only available to registered users who subscribe to a certain
                        Service (see Subscriptions and Gift Codes below). SoundCloud however remains free for users that
                        choose not to subscribe to such Services. In order to make the Platform available for free and
                        provide you with personally relevant features, we serve tailored ads on the Platform on behalf
                        of third party advertisers. To that end, we use information that you make available to us when
                        you interact with the Platform to inform the nature of the ads we show you and provide you with
                        a customized experience. More information on how we use data to show you personalized ads is
                        described in our Privacy Policy.

                        We may, from time to time, release new tools and resources on the Website, release new versions
                        of our Apps, or introduce other services and/or features for the Platform. Any new services and
                        features will be subject to these Terms of Use as well as any additional terms and conditions
                        that we may release for those specific services or features.</div>
